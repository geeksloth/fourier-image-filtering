# Image Fourier Transform Example
A simple demo of Fourier image transformation by from-scratch DFT and iDFT functions.

These 4 steps are:
1. Showing the original spatial domain of the input image.
2. Transform it into the Frequency Domain by applying the Fourier Transform, then show the F-image.
3. Cutting some frequencies area, this might be more complex process a you desire, then show the filtered F-image.
4. Transfrom into the Saptial Domain and show the result.
